# codeQuiz

The goal of this project is to create a dynamic, timed, multiple-choice quiz using Javascript. The quiz should have an attached timer that begins counting down when started. In addition, the user should be penalized when an incorrect anser is provided.

When the quiz concludes, the user should be able to enter their initials and view previous high scores.
